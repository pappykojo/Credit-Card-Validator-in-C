# Credit Card Validator

This is a simple C program that validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm (modulus 10).


## Description

This program provides a basic credit card number validation mechanism using the Luhn algorithm. The Luhn algorithm is a widely used checksum formula to verify the legitimacy of various identification numbers, including credit card numbers. Although this program validates the checksum, it does not connect to any financial institution or check the card's actual validity.

## How it Works

The program takes a credit card number as input from the user and then checks its validity using the Luhn algorithm. It follows these steps:

1. Prompt the user to enter the credit card number.
2. Calculate the checksum using the Luhn algorithm.
3. Validate the checksum to determine the credit card number's validity.
4. Display whether the credit card number is valid or not.

## Requirements

To compile and run the program, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-validator-c.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd credit-card-validator-c
   ```

## Usage

1. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   gcc credit_card_validator.c -o credit_card_validator
   ```

2. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./credit_card_validator
   ```

3. Enter the credit card number when prompted, and the program will output whether the credit card number is valid or not.

## Example

```
Enter the credit card number: 4556789123456789
The credit card number is valid.
```
